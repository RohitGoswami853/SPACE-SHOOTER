## Basic Logic

I have used the python pygame library for development.
The basic idea is by pressing up, down, left, right arrow the player will move the ships in the XY-axes. Up arrow means (y-1) that is the ship will go up on the axes.

Similarly, for the bullet (x+1) for the left ship and (x-1) for the right ship untill it reach the end or hit the ship.
